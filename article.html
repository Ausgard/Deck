            <p class="article-content__text">Of the many celestial phenomenons, there is probably none as exciting as when you see your first asteroid on the move in the heavens. To call asteroids the “rock stars” of astronomy is both a bad joke and an accurate depiction of how astronomy fans view them. Unlike suns, planets, and moons, asteroids are on the move, ever changing and, if they appear in the night sky, they are exciting and dynamic.</p>
